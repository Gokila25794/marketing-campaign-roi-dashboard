🔎 Key Insights

Channel 3 achieved ~98.96% CTR and 98.96% Conversion Rate — top performer

Organic Search generated highest revenue (~₹2,811.96) at controlled cost

Low CPC campaigns (~₹0.24) produced highest ROI (~458%)

Direct channel had highest spend (~₹1,003.59) but weaker ROI efficiency

New users (~61K) significantly exceeded returning users (~57K), but only ~15K key events — retention gap identified

Peak ROI observed at ~10 second engagement window, then performance declined

✅ Business Recommendations

Increase investment in Organic Search & low-CPC high-ROI channels

Audit and optimize high-spend Direct traffic campaigns

Reallocate budget from low-ROAS channels

Improve post-click engagement to increase key event conversion

Optimize landing pages for fast conversion within first 10–15 seconds

Replicate high-CTR ad creatives across weaker channels
